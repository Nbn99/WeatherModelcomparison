## Introduction

This project undertakes a comprehensive comparison of various forecasting models to predict temperature trends. Utilizing cutting-edge machine learning techniques including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D), and the traditional Prophet algorithm, we evaluate their efficacy in forecasting temperature patterns.


## Methodology

1. Data Collection: Historical temperature data from diverse geographical locations is collected spanning several years to capture seasonal and regional variations.
2. Data Preprocessing: The collected data is cleaned, normalized, and partitioned into training, validation, and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.
3. Model Implementation:
    - LSTM: A type of recurrent neural network known for its ability to capture long-term  dependencies in sequential data.
    - GRU: A variant of recurrent neural networks designed to address the vanishing gradient problem.
    - Conv1D: A convolutional neural network architecture adapted for one-dimensional input data such as time series.
    - Prophet: A time series forecasting tool developed by Facebook that incorporates seasonality, holidays, and trend changes.
    - Model Training: Each model is trained on the training dataset using appropriate hyperparameters and optimization techniques.
    - Comparative Analysis: The performance of each model is compared based on its ability to accurately forecast temperature trends across different time horizons and geographical locations
